# 2. Use Python

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a scripting language to build the tooling. We have experience
deploying and maintaining Python based applications in production.

## Decision

We will use Python.

## Consequences

We have more Python support across teams than other languages so choosing this
for a cross team project will allow for efficient development and maintenance.
